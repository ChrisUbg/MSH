# Smart Home Project Definition

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop and implement a smart home software system based on the Matter protocol. The system will be designed to run in Docker containers on a Raspberry Pi, with a focus on open-source solutions and framework-agnostic design.

## Core Requirements

- Hierarchical structure: Building → Rooms → Devices
- Device grouping capabilities
- Room grouping capabilities
- Device templates and profiles

#### User and Rule Management
- Local authentication system
- Role-based access control
- User permissions per room/device
- Rule creation and management interface

#### Language Handling
- DeepL integration for translations
- Multi-language support for UI
- Localization settings

### 2. Monitoring Functions
#### Environmental Monitoring
- Temperature tracking
- Humidity monitoring
- Weather data integration
- Real-time status display

#### Device Status Monitoring
- Online/offline status
- Current state monitoring
- Error reporting
- Performance metrics

### 3. Statistic Functions
#### Usage Statistics
- Device on/off duration tracking
- Most used settings analysis
- Setting change frequency
- User interaction tracking

#### Performance Analytics
- System health metrics
- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring

#### Trend Analysis
- Usage patterns
- Energy consumption
- Maintenance indicators

### 4. Device Handling Functions
#### Basic Controls
- On/off switching
- Dimming controls
- Temperature regulation
- Time-based controls

#### Hierarchical Control Layers
- Individual device control

### 5. Security & Privacy
#### Network Security
- Local network isolation
- Secure device communication
- Matter protocol security features

#### Access Control
- Local authentication
- Role-based permissions
- Device access restrictions

#### Data Protection
- Local data storage
- Encrypted communication
- Secure device commissioning

#### Mobile Access (Future)
- Secure remote access
- Device commissioning security
- Mobile authentication

## Technical Stack
- Backend: C# (Blazor Server)
- Frontend: Framework-agnostic (preferred: Blazor)
- Matter Protocol: Python (if C# implementation not possible)
- Containerization: Docker
- Platform: Raspberry Pi

## Development Rules
- All development rules defined in BASIC_RULES.md and /home/chris/RiderProjects/DevelopmentRules supersede any rules stated in this document
- Project should be designed to be protocol and database agnostic
- Frontend should be framework agnostic
- Implementation should follow the process flow documentation referenced in BASIC_RULES.md
