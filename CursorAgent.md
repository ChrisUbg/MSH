# MSH Smart Home System - AI Context Documentation

## üè† **Project Overview**
**MSH (Matter Smart Home)** is a comprehensive, local-first smart home management system running on Raspberry Pi, focusing on Matter protocol integration with a clean, layered architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Core Components**
- **MSH.Web** (C# .NET 8 Blazor Server) - Main web application
- **MSH.Core** - Domain/business logic layer
- **MSH.Infrastructure** - Data access layer with Entity Framework Core
- **MSH.Matter** - Matter integration layer (Lightweight Python)
- **PostgreSQL Database** - Primary data storage
- **Python Matter Bridge** - FastAPI HTTP bridge using python-matter-server
- **Docker Compose** - Production containerization

### **Network Architecture (Hybrid Approach)**
The system uses a hybrid network approach with three main goals:

1. **Device Independence**: Pi manages all Matter devices on its own network
   - Pi operates in Access Point mode for device commissioning and control
   - All Matter devices join the Pi's network for direct control
   - Independent of main WiFi changes or failures

2. **Data Persistence & Recovery**: Robust against data loss
   - All device data stored in PostgreSQL on Pi
   - Commissioning data persisted to prevent re-commissioning
   - Backup procedures for easy Pi hardware replacement
   - No need to re-commission devices when Pi hardware changes

3. **User Accessibility**: Comfortable access via main WiFi
   - Pi also connects to main WiFi in client mode
   - Web UI accessible from main network devices
   - Future smartphone app will connect via main WiFi
   - Single network for user access while maintaining device independence

### **Commissioning Strategy**
- **Primary Mode**: Pi Access Point for device commissioning
- **Device Network**: All Matter devices join Pi's network
- **User Access**: Pi bridges to main WiFi for web/smartphone access
- **Data Storage**: All commissioning data stored in PostgreSQL
- **Recovery**: Backup/restore procedures for seamless hardware replacement

});
```

## üìÅ **Key Files & Locations**

### **Core Application Files (UNCHANGED)**

- `src/MSH.Infrastructure/Entities/Device.cs` - Device domain model

### **Matter Bridge Files (UPDATED)**
- `Matter/app/main_simple.py` - Python FastAPI bridge (python-matter-server integration)
- `Matter/Dockerfile.simple` - Lightweight container build

- `Matter/entrypoint.sh` - Container startup script

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Official Deployment Process (Cross-Compilation)**

To ensure build consistency, speed, and reliability, the official and **required** deployment method is cross-compilation from the x86 development machine. **Directly building on the Raspberry Pi is unreliable and must be avoided.**

The process is managed by the `build-and-deploy-matter.sh` script, which performs the following steps:
1.  **Builds ARM64 Docker Images:** Uses `docker buildx` on the development machine to compile the C# and Python applications into images compatible with the Raspberry Pi's `arm64` architecture.
2.  **Transfers Images to Pi:** Securely copies the final, built images to the Raspberry Pi.
3.  **Restarts Services:** Uses `docker-compose` on the Pi to pull the new images and restart the relevant services.

This workflow guarantees that all builds are performed in a stable environment and bypasses the resource and system-level instabilities of building directly on the Pi.

## üîß **Recent Critical Fixes**

### **Network Mode Switching Docker Networking Fix (2024-01-21)**
- **Issue**: Network mode switching worked via `http://192.168.0.102:8083` but failed via `http://localhost:8083`
- **Root Cause**: HttpClient configured with hardcoded `http://localhost:8082/` base URL caused Docker networking conflicts
- **Problem**: When accessing via `localhost:8083`, internal API calls to `localhost:8082` failed due to container network context differences
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Updated `NetworkSettings.razor` to use dynamic HttpClient base URL
  - Implemented JavaScript-based current URL detection: `window.location.origin`
  - HttpClient now uses same host as current request (localhost:8083 ‚Üí localhost:8083, Pi IP ‚Üí Pi IP)
  - Removed dependency on hardcoded "API" HttpClient configuration for network settings
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Network mode switching now works from both access methods
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/MSH.Web/Pages/NetworkSettings.razor` - Dynamic HttpClient configuration
  - Added `@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime` for URL detection
  - Modified `OnInitializedAsync()` to set dynamic base URL

### **PostgreSQL Authentication Permanent Fix**
- **Implemented permanent database initialization** with `init-db.sql` and proper Docker configuration
- **Created automated fix script** `fix-database-auth.sh` for when authentication issues occur
- **Updated Docker Compose** with proper health checks and database dependency management
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Database authentication issues resolved permanently

*Commissioning Implementation Plan Added: 2024-01-21* 

## üîç **Bluetooth Commissioning Diagnosis (2024-01-22)**

### **Problem Statement**
Commissioning fails with error: `"Bluetooth commissioning is not available"` for both BLE and WiFi methods.

### **Diagnostic Results**

#### **1. Hardware & System Status**
- ‚úÖ **Host Bluetooth**: UART-based `hci0` interface running and powered
- ‚úÖ **D-Bus Access**: Container can communicate with host Bluetooth via D-Bus
- ‚ùå **HCI Socket**: Container cannot open HCI socket (`Address family not supported by protocol`)
- ‚úÖ **python-matter-server**: Version 7.0.1 with home-assistant-chip-core 2024.11.4

#### **2. Software Component Analysis**
- ‚úÖ **Custom Commissioner**: Reports `"ble_support": true` and `"wifi_support": true`
- ‚ùå **python-matter-server**: Reports `"bluetooth_enabled": False`
- ‚ùå **Commissioning Commands**: `commission_with_code` and `set_wifi_credentials` fail
- ‚ùå **Real Commissioning**: Custom class falls back to simulation, not real commissioning

#### **3. Root Cause Identified**
**The issue is architectural, not configuration:**

1. **Container Limitations**: Docker containers cannot access UART-based Bluetooth HCI sockets on Raspberry Pi
2. **Simulation vs Reality**: Custom `RealMatterCommissioner` class reports success but actually falls back to simulation
3. **python-matter-server Requirements**: Needs direct hardware access for real Matter commissioning
4. **D-Bus Insufficient**: While D-Bus communication works, python-matter-server requires HCI socket access

### **Diagnosis Outcome**
**Current containerized approach cannot perform real Matter commissioning** because:
- UART-based Bluetooth on Pi doesn't create `/dev/hci0` device files
- Container networking prevents direct HCI socket access
- python-matter-server requires hardware-level Bluetooth access
- Custom commissioning class is simulating success, not performing real commissioning

### **Sustainable Solution Required**
**Move python-matter-server to host** where it can access Bluetooth hardware directly, while keeping the C# application containerized.
