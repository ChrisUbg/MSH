- if something releated at a process flow, the refere at 
/home/chris/RiderProjects/DevelopmentRules/diagram-blueprint-instructions.md and data-backup-process-blueprint.drawio documentation.

- The rules defined in this file or at the /home/chris/RiderProjects/DevelopmentRules superseeds all within this solution stated rules. Including the PROJECT_ROADMAP.md

- The projcect should run at the mentioned Raspberry Pi, But in docker container. This should be refelcted at the current implementation state.

- The main goal is to develop and implement a smart home software, using the matter protocol. It should be based on open source libraries and frameworks. Where possible, Blazor Server, Bootstrap, C# as backend. For the matter part preferable Phyton if C# is not possible. Even the main goal is using the new matter protocol, the software should be designed beeing agnostic of this protocoll or certain db. Even though Blazor as a Frontend is preferred. The frontend should be framework agnostic too. 

- The TODO.md is the backlog.  Which is to work on.

- For later
-- relaying on the Haustagebuch.sln. E.g. port using for preventing conflicts.
-- internet modem from A1. But no access at the admin level. Maby connecting a second wlan router with admin access. for setting a static IP.
