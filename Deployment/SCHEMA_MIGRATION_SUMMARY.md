# MSH Schema Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the schema migration that was performed to resolve EF Core issues with PostgreSQL multi-schema handling.

## Problem

The original `public` schema had issues with:
- Shadow properties not being handled correctly
- Navigation properties causing EF Core errors
- Migration history table conflicts

## Solution

1. **Created `db` schema**: As a workaround to bypass EF Core issues
2. **Migrated data**: Moved all tables and data to the `db` schema
3. **Discovered limitation**: EF Core doesn't handle multi-schema PostgreSQL well
4. **Final solution**: Renamed `db` schema back to `public` and renamed original `public` to `public_org` as backup

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Schema Renaming
```bash
# Rename original public schema to public_org (backup)
ALTER SCHEMA public RENAME TO public_org;

# Rename db schema to public
ALTER SCHEMA db RENAME TO public;
```

### Step 2: Code Updates
- Removed `HasDefaultSchema("db")` from `ApplicationDbContext`
- Removed `SearchPath=db` from connection strings
- Removed `MigrationsHistoryTable("__EFMigrationsHistory", "db")` from Program.cs
- Updated all deployment scripts to use public schema

### Step 3: Migration Regeneration
- Removed old migration files that referenced `db` schema
- Generated new migrations that use `public` schema
- Applied migrations successfully

## Current State

✅ **Public schema**: Contains all tables and data with proper migration history
✅ **Public_org schema**: Backup of original schema (can be dropped if not needed)
✅ **EF Core**: Working correctly with public schema
✅ **Migrations**: All applied successfully

## Files Updated

### Application Code
- `src/MSH.Infrastructure/Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs` - Removed db schema configuration
- `src/MSH.Web/appsettings.json` - Removed SearchPath=db
- `src/MSH.Web/Program.cs` - Removed db schema references

### Deployment Scripts
- `Deployment/apply_migrations.sh` - Updated to use public schema
- `Deployment/migrate_schema_to_public.sh` - Created for schema migration

## Verification

```bash
# Check migration status
dotnet ef migrations list --project MSH.Infrastructure --startup-project MSH.Web

# Check tables in public schema
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 192.168.0.107 -p 5435 -U postgres -d matter_dev -c "\dt public.*"

# Check migration history
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 192.168.0.107 -p 5435 -U postgres -d matter_dev -c "SELECT * FROM public.\"__EFMigrationsHistory\" ORDER BY \"MigrationId\";"
```

## Benefits

✅ **EF Core Compatibility**: Full compatibility with PostgreSQL
✅ **Standard Schema**: Using the default `public` schema
✅ **Migration System**: Works correctly without custom configuration
✅ **Future Development**: Easy to add new entities and migrations
✅ **Deployment**: Simplified deployment scripts

## Next Steps

1. **Test Application**: Verify all functionality works correctly
2. **Optional Cleanup**: Drop `public_org` schema if backup is no longer needed
3. **Continue Development**: Add new features using standard EF Core practices

## Backup

A backup was created before the migration:
- `backup_before_schema_migration_20250823_203043.sql`

This backup contains both the original `public` schema and the `db` schema data.
